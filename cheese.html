    <p>The art of cheesemaking is referred to in ancient Greek mythology and evidence of cheese
      and cheesemaking has been found on Egyptian tomb murals dating back over 4000 years.
      Cheese may have been discovered accidentally by the practice of storing milk in containers
      made from the stomachs of animals.</p>
